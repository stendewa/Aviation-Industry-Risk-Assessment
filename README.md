#Aviation Industry Risk Assessment To Determine The Most Suitable Airplaine Models
<<<<<<< HEAD
## ..*Overview
=======
##..*Contents
1. Jupyter Notebook with the cleaned data frame and the applied code
2. Interactive Tableau Workbook
3. The original Datasets

## ..*Data Understanding And Analysis
I used a data set from the National Transportation Safety Board dated from 1982 to 2022 
with detailed descripions of aircraft related accidents that occured within the aforementioned time frame.
*The main points of focus were 
1. Which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor
2. The main cause of plane accidents and a suggestion on how to mitigate it
3. The Aircraft Damage and Fatalities per airplane maker
The visualisations included in the Jupyter Notebook are representative of the models with less injuries and less damage to the planes.

# Below is a link of the Visualisations Created From The Data On Tableau

## ..*Conclusion
After analysing the data on Jupyter Notebook: 
.The safest plane seemed to the **_Ilyushin_** models with fewer deaths on average
.The less damage prone plane was the **_Boeing_** models with less substantial and destroyed damage than the other popular models
.The greatest cause to airplane damage was the **_pilot's decision_** and this can be minimized through hiring qualified, experienced and vetted pilots.
