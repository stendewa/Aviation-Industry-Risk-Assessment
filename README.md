# Aviation Industry Risk Assessment to Determine the Most Suitable Airplane Models

## Overview

- The original datasets

### Data Understanding and Analysis
I used a dataset from the National Transportation Safety Board, covering the period from 1982 to 2022, with detailed descriptions of aircraft-related accidents that occurred within this timeframe. The main points of focus were:

1. Identifying which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor.
2. Determining the main cause of plane accidents and suggesting ways to mitigate it.
3. Analyzing the aircraft damage and fatalities per airplane maker.

The visualizations included in the Jupyter Notebook represent the models with fewer injuries and less damage to the planes.

### Visualizations
Below is a link to the visualizations created from the data on Tableau:

### Conclusion
After analyzing the data in the Jupyter Notebook, the findings are as follows:

- The safest plane models appear to be the Ilyushin models, which have fewer deaths on average.
- The Boeing models are the least damage-prone, with less substantial and destroyed damage compared to other popular models.
- The greatest cause of airplane damage was related to fuel issues. This can be minimized by vetting suppliers and having competent mechanics test the fuel before adding it to the planes.
